Version 4.5.0:

	* Updated MEME and MAST command line parameters to be
	all-inclusive. This is because I was informed that the new MEME
	4.4.0 got rid of the -d command line option. So to consolidate for
	when this happens again, "meme.consensus",
	"meme.consensus.e.val.limit", "meme.palindrome.option",
	"meme.addl.args" are gone, all "sucked up" into "meme.cmd".

	* Seeding moved from cmonkey.init() to cmonkey() so a saved
	initialized env. can be used for multiple cmonkey runs. Also, if
	this is the case, the random seed is modified for each run based
	on a single initialized env.

	* cmonkey.params environment was storing extraneous links to other
	environments; fixed this. Now resulting RData files (after a full
	cMonkey run) will be smaller.

	* "Masking" of sequences is now in its own function,
	"filter.sequences()", which does the masking of repeat regions,
	duplicated regions, ATGs, etc. This is called by get.sequences()
	with arguments passed via "...".

	* Parallelization now uses doMC (wrapper around multicore). This
	will eventually enable parallelization via SNOW (sockets, PVM and
	MPI), MapReduce, or even SMP for parallelization on Windows.

	* Can now seed clusters via a list of lists of genes, and set the
	"maintain.seed" parameter to a list of lists of genes/conditiosn
	to keep in a given (set of) clusters.

	* Major bug fixes and improvements to write.project(), with
	sortable columns in the main HTML table

	* New function plots histograms of motif positions in plot.stats()
