NOTE: suggested packages: multicore, igraph
      optional packages: RSVGTipsDevice, fUtilities, trimcluster

Actually all packages are optional - it will still run without them, just without any
nice network plotting or multi-core computing

For INSTRUCTIONS, see README section below.

TODO:

-1. DONE(3) Need to normalize net.weights by (1) number of edges or (2) number of 
	nodes or (3) sum of combined_score. This will make sure that HUGE
	networks are not dominating the network stats.
0. DONE test STRING-based cluster seeding and do network-filtered correlation-based 
     	seeding as in old version of cmonkey (DONE).
00. DONE (option seed.method[row="list=XXX"] where XXX is either a list (in memory)
	of character vectors, or a file with lists of genes, one line per cluster):
	allow seeding/constraining of clusters with user-provided lists of genes
000. use STRING for operon predictions instead of those from RSAT. 
	NO - using MicrobesOnline instead now.
0000. add GO (and when KEGG is done, that too) as possible network/groupings to 
	constrain clustering
00000. add KEGG met network (with compounds removed) as a network as in old version
1. (DONE in get.row.scores - need to add reading/parsing and storing of weights
      parameter) allow weighting of conditions in calculation of row.scores -
      arbitrarily up-weight some (e.g. if we want a certain experiment to be a
      greater constraint on the clustering) or based on how well they fit in the
	cluster. (NOTE - also consider doing this for TF knockout conditions!)
1a. weight conditions based on their score for belonging in the cluster 
	(better/tighter ones are up-weighted)
2. allow weighting of rows in calculation of row.scores (for mean profile) - 
      a. higher weight for better match to motif
      b. higher weight for better network score
2a. allow weighing of rows in calculation of col.scores analogous to (1) using
      criteria 2(a) and 2(b).
3. allow weighting of rows in motif finding based on their row.score. THIS IS
      POSSIBLE USING MEME -- see below!
      ALSO: down-weight duplicate upstream sequences (e.g. to 0.5) instead of
        removing them (which is what happens if uniquify.sequences is TRUE)
   3a. possibly use gibbs sampler to do this
4. include function to override database that is used to get transcription start
      sites (currently annotated ATG from RSAT db) in get.upstream.seqs(). 
      Override the TSS with those identified from tiling array data (Halo).
5. include chip-chip data in Halo run as a network "grouping file".
6. add condition-groupings analogous to gene groupings
7. update motif finding to include priors on sequences, position and pairings:
	(a) up-weight upstream seqs for genes with closer match to cluster in 
		resid and/or networks
	(b) up-weight positions hit in chip-chip (for TFs that seem to
		be overrepresented in hits to genes in cluster)
	(c) weight closer to ATG higher, slowly (linearly) decreasing to zero at ~250 (?)
	(d) weight pairs of motifs that are close together (or have same distance from
		each other in multiple sequences)
	(e) up-weight motifs that are at roughly similar distance from ATG in multiple
		sequences (using gaussian prior)
8. (NEARLYDONE?) For Meme runs, reinstate the palindrome motif search --- keep motif(s) 
	with best e-value

10. TO TRY -- inferelator-based row-scores: 
	(a) for row membership, use glmnet on every gene, group genes
		based on similarity of predicted influence sets
	(b) (related to (a)) for col membership, use mean RMSD of prediction 
		from (a) for genes in cluster
	(c) store big matrices on disk via dbdf or ff or some such...

INFERELATOR TODOS:

1. DONE: use glmnet and no TF groups, use custom CV function that Phu is working on to select lambda
2. DONE: add weights for influences via glmnet's 'penalty.factor'... weights to add:
	a. NOT DONEL up-weight TFs closer to genes on genome (as in Tai,McCue,Stormo 2005 Genome Res. paper)
	b. NOT DONE: up-weight env. influences if related conditions are present in bicluster
	c. NOT DONE: up-weight combos of TFs (e.g TFBs with TBPs)
	d. NOT DONE: up-weight TFs based on chip-chip and/or motifs
3. DONE: consider adding weights to y's (based on variance from zero or certain experiments 
	to up-weight)

OLD TODO:
1. (DONE via row.quantile?) need to allow for gene is not always in n.clust.per.row clusters
2. Use MEMERIS with assigned probabilities for positions of motifs based on ChIP-chip and gene start site.
   IDEA: can assign multiple potential positions of motifs (e.g. for gene in operon) by
    a "multi-humped" probability distribution to constrain MEMERIS.
       TODO: will have to edit MEMERIS code to allow both strands.
4. (DONE) Dynamically(?) get STRING interactions and incorporate those
5. Get KEGG co-pathway localization from e.g. ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/genes/organisms/hal/hal_pathway.list

*************************************************

NOTE as of 12/12/08 the total (non-plotting) lines of this code is 1404 vs. 8172 for old cMonkey.
     as of 03/04/09        the lines of code is 1708   (but also includes everything in if(FALSE){...} )
     as of 03/04/09        the lines of code is 1571   (after replacing simplePara with multicore)
     as of 03/07/09        the lines of code is 1648   (after removing organism-specific code out of main code)
     as of 03/30/09        the lines of code is 1876
     as of 04/06/09        the lines of code is 1892   (after adding lots of download-file and annotation code)

Command to get this count: cat cmonkey*.R | grep -vE '^ *##' | grep -vE '^ *$' | wc -l

     as of 04/14/09        the lines of code is 2679   (now using the new command above vs. 9109 for old cMonkey)
     as of 05/20/09        the lines of code is 3068   (lots of new bookkeeping code added)
     as of 06/03/09        the lines of code is 2994   (good version 4k, not including cmonkey-experimental.R code)

NOTE: to get "k-means clustering", use: n.clust.per.row=1; n.clust.per.col=ncol(ratios);
    row.quantile=col.quantile=NA; mot.iters=net.iters=NA ...
To get "constrained k-means clustering", dont set mot.iters=net.iters=NA .

NOTE: to run in a local environment: NEED TO MAKE SURE multicore works w/ this (it seems to!):
        cmonkey.env <- new.env(); sys.source( "cmonkey.R", cmonkey.env )
Can get it to not init by (before sourcing): {assign("dont.init",T,env=e)}
Then after running, {attach(e)} will put everything on the search path.

NOTE: can also run inside a function with function args orverriding default params, e.g.:
    cmonkey <- function( organism="hpy" ) source( "cmonkey.R", local=T ); cmonkey()
 but everything is in a local environment which is lost if the function dies.
But can have a function that has everything stored in an (externally accessable) environment via:
    cmonkey <- function( organism="hpy" ) { cmonkey.env <<- new.env(); source( "cmonkey.R", local=T ) }; cmonkey()
NOTE: This type of function is now implemented in cmonkey.R

NOTE: can check yeast motifs detected via search at http://www.yeastract.com/formsearchbydnamotif.php

***********************************
MEME allows sequence weights!!!

                       Sequence weights may be specified in the dataset
                        file by special header lines where the unique name
                        is "WEIGHTS" (all caps) and the descriptive 
                        text is a list of sequence weights. 
                        Sequence weights are numbers in the range 0 < w <=1.
                        All weights are assigned in order to the
                        sequences in the file. If there are more sequences
                        than weights, the remainder are given weight one.
                        Weights must be greater than zero and less than
                        or equal to one.  Weights may be specified by
                        more than one "WEIGHT" entry which may appear
                        anywhere in the file.  When weights are used, 
                        sequences will contribute to motifs in proportion
                        to their weights.  Here is an example for a file
                        of three sequences where the first two sequences are 
                        very similar and it is desired to down-weight them:
  
                        >WEIGHTS 0.5 .5 1.0 
                        >seq1
